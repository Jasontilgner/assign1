 <p align = "center">This position would also appeal to me as I would hopefully get to work in a group setting who are also passionate about technology, and who like myself are always keen to look at new technology and computer systems.</P>
 <p align = "center"> This position is ideal for me as it suites my next career step progression but it also suites my personal interests in IT.</p>

 <p align = "center"> For the job description above as I don’t currently have all the trade technical skills required there a couple of different things, I will need to plan to gain the qualifications, skills and experience required within the position description:</P>
 <p align = "center"> •	While there is no formal education degree required there are a number of technical skills required, in most cases it is highly unlikely that a workplace will teach or provide on the job learning unless through a traineeship. Most of these skills you can get a solid foundation through a university degree such as Bachelor of Information Systems, so the first stage I would look at doing is completing this degree. It will also provide other skills as you progress through your degree like teamwork, meeting deadlines, technical trade skills, and also help prepare you for this type of work environment. I also have some experience in business information systems so this would help enhance this.</P>
 <p align = "center"> •	Once the bachelor has been attained and we have a solid foundation the next stage would be to apply for job that is taking hiring specifically for an undergraduate generally these are workplaces looking to take on students that have recently completed a university degree and can look to expand on the foundation skills set. In my specific case it would be looking for an employer that is taking on a junior developer / programmer , that would be able to support and help grow my technical trade skills such as Java-script programming. I already have a bit of a background in how business information systems work, and how a team operates in a software development company so the emphasis here is to increase my trade skills / programming skills.</P>
 <p align = "center"> •	While undertaking the above I would also look at doing some additional education training at the same time while making the transition from junior to immediate developer, such courses could be short-courses for javascript:https://online.rmit.edu.au/course/sc-front-end-web-developer-dev102?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI28yvjNCx5gIVWQ4rCh3jgA_mEAAYASAAEgL7jfD_BwE</P>
 <p align = "center"> •	Once I have been working for the junior position for about three to four years and completed a number of projects, and have confidence of my own skill set I would then look at applying for the main job. As I would the technical programming skills, the necessary background IT business skills, and the team environment skills to consider applying. </p>
