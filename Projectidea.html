 <h1 align="center">Project Work</h1> 
 <h2 align="center">Project Idea</h2> 
 <p align="center">The project idea that I have expressed an interest in, is a mobile device app that is capable of running on either a MAC or Android device. It would assist a person who has an online recipe URL that can be entered into the application, and would give them a break down of the ingredients they need to buy. It would also allow you to select the closest major super market via location services to choose to get these from. The idea of the application is to allow the target audience, full time workers or parents who enjoy cooking. Instead of relying on memory or forgotten bits of paper after a day at work or parenting, can use the application to get the ingredients they need for the key recipe they want to cook.</P>

  <h2 align="center">Project Motivation</h2>
  <p align = "center">The main idea and motivation for this project idea is that I am also passionate about cooking when I get time so I decided to look into an idea that incorporates IT and cooking. However, the downside is we always know someone who forgot a shipping list or key ingredient for the recipe they are following so I have decided to focus on this as it keeps happening to me or someone I know. This is mostly full-time workers or full-time parents just on the up and go so I believe this could be of real benefit. While yes it would be more designed for a recipe-based input it still could factor other uses such as additional ingredients. According to app clarify, more than 94% percent of items forgotten of a shopping list we use are main ingredient or key items in mainstream cooking. Also, as the app is on the phone it couldnt be forgotten like a shopping list.</P>

 <h2 align = "center">Project Idea Description or How will it work</h2>
 
 <p align = "center">The application would be store based on google play for android and itunes for mac devices once the application is released to both stores the users would need to create an account with either of these to be able to access the store application. The application would start based on user input of an online recipe that they are needing to buy the ingredients for, the user would enter the web address or universal resource locator link of the recipe. This allows the user to enter and save the recipe of there choice into the app and not have to refer back to the original website, especially if it’s particular favorite.
The application would then ask if the user would like to shop for the ingredients based on original serving size or convert the required ingredients quantity to the desired number. In case the user is making more than the normal portions the recipe originally was catered for. The idea is for the application to be taking the guess work out for the user, they just need to input the required information.
At this point the application will then break down the ingredients to match what is required and has been inputted with any changes, then using the phones GPS / location services it will then search the local major supermarkets Coles, Woolworths, etc for these ingredients. There are a number of export APIs from the supermarkets for the products search to be linked in and included in the program, however these will need to be requested. The user can then search the ingredients list at which ever supermarket they prefer to shop at. They will also be able to view prices and specials.
Once the user actually goes as does the shopping, they need for the recipe they are trying to create, the ingredients will be in a list format so that they can go and pick from the supermarket. They can scan or tick the ingredients off in the list this will also allow the application to know the user has what they need.Once the user has the ingredients back at home and everything they need, the application will provide the instructions how to create the recipe this is done as part of the information convert from the URL information.</P> 

  <h2 align = "center">Project Idea Tools and Skills needed</h2>
  <p align = "center">The first main tool we are going to need to help make this program work is a group platform that can be used for communication between team members working on the project. This is called discord, discord is a freeware digital chat communication tool that allows users to communicate between one another. This would be used to talk to members as progress is done on the application and to transmit files as working is being updated. This is key to getting communication sorted. A mobile device running android and an iphone device would be essential as these are the hardware platforms the mobile application will be running from. These are everyday mobile phone devices that any every day user has, can make phone calls, txt, and run phone applications. The mobile application program that we need to use to be able to program code it in both types of environments is called visual studios professional. Getting access to discord isn’t super hard and setting up a server for a group project isn’t a massive challenge in relation to this project the biggest milestone for the completion of the project would be the cost associated with visual studios professional. </P>
  
   <h2 align = "center">Project Outcome</h2>
   <p align = "center">If the project was to be developed successful I don’t believe it would be a massive award winning application within the top 50 of the google play store, however I believe it will have the effect of making it easier for users to keep track of the ingredients they need for there recipes and also make it simpler to get at the supermarket. The development will impact in the way that users can get and view recipes.</p>
