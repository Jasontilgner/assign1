<p align = "center">As part of the assignment we are required to do some online learning tests that will help with our learning. Below are the results of the three taken</P>

   <p align = "center">The first picture examples 1.1 to 1.4 is the Myer Briggs test this is used to test a persons personality, strengths and preferences. This would be useful to an employer as it can indicate what their personality type is, and what their strengths are so they could be position within the organisation to better effect. Based on the results in picture 1.1 to 1.4 I look at things with an outwards perception, and I benefit from a busy environment. I also tend to be thinking about future situations. This can be useful to an employer in the IT workplace as it indicates I can work well in busy situations and also be thinking on the go without overthinking. It also allows me to try and lookout for future problems before they happen. The downside is that I can get distracted sometimes.</P>
   <p align = "center">The above test examples show that in a team environment my behaviour could be influenced by that the fact that I have a dynamic outward personality / preference, that I could be overshadowing other team members that are not as vocal / loud with there thoughts. I would need to give some good consideration to these members as they could have the solution to a problem I am having, but may not know how to express their thoughts or present themselves. I may also present to be overbearing in my behaviour when this wouldn’t be the case. 
   When forming and organising teams I need to remember to take into account not to be overbearing as some members may not respond well to this, but also based on my thinking style at first, I will also take away ideas and come back with a solution. I also believe that this approach will help round up any issues with my more dynamic style of personality.</P>

 <p align = "center">The second picture example is the results of the outcome of an online learning test or what type of learning method bests suites you. This is useful to a prospective employer as it would allow a manager or trainer to best identify the best method of approaching there training. The results I received for myself indicate that I am a strong visual learner, this means that my best method of learning is through pictures and sights. This would allow for me to learn through visual means while on the job training, also it means I am neat in my work place area (true fact I cant stand a dirty office). So tasks such as learning from books or manuals are a lot easier for myself, however I can stumble a bit if given a task through verbals means and it is overloaded in instruction.</P>
 
 <p align = "center">The behaviour of the visual learning style means that in a team my performance would be at maximum using sights and colourful materials. However this could also be a disadvantage in a busy team especially if a number of verbal instructions where given and I didnt understand or interrupted the task incorrectly. This could lead to myself being frustrated or creating conflict in the team when it isnt necessary. This could also be the same problem in reverse with another member who may only do well with verbal requests.
When organising a team it is important we consider all different types of learning styles so that every member is comfortable and able to contribute using there particular style. This could be having written documentation for a visual learner followed up later with a verbal chat to reinforce for the verbal type of learner.</P>

 <p align = "center">The three-picture example 3.1 to 3.2 is the results of an online personality test based on a colour scheme. The colours are based on different attributes like creative, decision maker, etc.
The colours refer to different moods and images. This gives an employer an understanding of what type of attributes you are strong in, creative, careful, headstrong. My own results indicated that I am very dynamic in what I do, and I know how to listen to people. To an employer this could indicate that I can help keep part of team moving forward, and that I know how to deal with different types of people.</p>

<p align = "center">When looking into attributes my behaviour could be effected in a team environment by being initiative and creative this could lead me to putting across several different ideas to team members and taking the lead if there is a lack of management or leadership. I would just need to ensure that when organising a team with this attribute to also let other members contribute to being creative otherwise they could become disheartened and lazy due to lack of interest.</P>
