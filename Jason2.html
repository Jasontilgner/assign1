 <h2 align="center">Interest and Background in IT</h2> 
 <p align="center">My interest in IT began when I was around twelve years old when my family first got our very first computer,</P>
 <p align = "center">I then questioned on how a computer operates and how hardware operates</P>
 <p align = "center">As computer systems where still on the rise at this point in time.</P>

 <P align = "center">Not every household had a personal computer so this was exciting.</P>
 <p align = "center">Since then I have taken a massive interest in IT and computer systems and eventually after high school, I turned this into a career choice</P>
 <p align = "center">As a ninety’s child I have seen the advance and evolution of computer systems from PC in just home use to the advances of the internet, NBN, Social media etc</P>
 <p align = "center"> While these have advantages and disadvantages in both technology, ethics, and social these have impacted on my life in different ways, enough that I was interested in exploring IT as a career.</P>
 <p align = "center">An example of an direct impact from IT would be the social media aspect, as social media only came out in my first years of high school I was the quieter kids so it actually gave me the change to learn to communicate with my peers via Facebook</P>
 <p align = "center"> However this also lead to a few incidents of being bullied online. Now I use social media for most things to communicate with my family overseas.</P>
 <p align = "center"> and I got a job via linked in,https://au.linkedin.com/</P>
 <p align = "center"> This is why I am super interested in it as a subject because of the impact it can have on daily life. I have a huge interest in the creation of software development.</P>
 <p align  = "center">My background experience in IT is I have worked roughly around the last 10 years in doing various rolls this includes IT administration, IT hardware, General and Application Support, and Client Services support.</P>
 <p align = "center"> I have been training in both for about five years and enjoy how fit it can keep you and then apply this to everyday life.</P>
 <p align = "center"> I have chosen to study at RMIT as I wish to complete my Bachelor of Information Technology </P>
 <p align = "center"> I unfortunately have found through my career when looking for work in the industry that a majority of employers prefer skilled experience and also a degree.</P>

 <p align = "center"> I am now looking to expand and have some career progression into software development.</P>
 <p align = "center"> I have mostly been supporting general or inhouse applications for the first main part of my career,</P>
 <p align = "center"> so I would like the opportunity to learn about creating software.</P>
 <p align = "center"> This is also ties into my personal interests of how computer systems operates, I have tied my personal interests and my career options in together.</P>
 <p align = "center"> I believe that from personal experience you should be doing something you enjoy it makes life much easier.</P>

 <p align = "center"> I would like to learning during my studies all the technical skills like programming so that I could achieve my dream job of learning to be a developer</P>
 <p align = "center"> , however I think it would also be important to learn the fundamentals of IT in a structured environment</P>
 <p align = "center"> As I have some experience in the industry but I don’t have a massive solid foundation so I think things like learning to work in a time in a structured environment would be good</P>
<p align = "center"> It will also allow me the opportunity to help teach other students who may not have this foundation things like working under pressure and that deadlines can’t be missed.  </P>
